# Natural Language

1. Prefer American english words over British english words.

   **Context:** Many programming terms use American English, so it’s easier to follow that
   convention.
   e.g. `color`.

**References:**

# Package

1. Prefer multiple words separated by hyphens or underscores over concatenating them into a single
   word.

   e.g. `finance_manager` vs `financemanager`.

   Refer [Dictionary](dictionary.md) for more details.

## Braces and Blocks

1. Always use curly braces `{}` for blocks, even for single-line statements.

   **Context:** This improves readability and maintains consistency.
   e.g.
   Use

   ```kotlin
   if (condition) {
     doSomething()
   }
   ```

   instead of

   ```kotlin
   if (condition) doSomething()
   ```

2. Use K&R style (opening brace on the same line).

## Function Expressions

1. Avoid using function expressions.

   **Context:** Function expressions can lead to less readable code, especially when the function
   body is complex or spans multiple lines. Use regular function declarations instead. Follow this
   even for small function body to maintain consistency.
   e.g.
   Use

   ```kotlin
   fun doSomething() {
       // implementation
   }
   ```

   instead of

   ```kotlin
   val doSomething = { /* implementation */ }
   ```

## Line Breaks

1. Brackets
   Always put a new line after the opening brace `{` and before the closing brace `}`.

   **Context:** This improves readability and makes it easier to visually parse code blocks.
   e.g.
   Use

   ```kotlin
   if (condition) {
       doSomething()
   }
   ```

   instead of

   ```kotlin
   if (condition) { doSomething() }
   ```

2. Named parameter
   Place each named parameter on a separate line for every Kotlin method call.

   **Context:** This enhances readability, especially when dealing with functions that have multiple
   parameters.
   e.g.
   Use

   ```kotlin
   someFunction(
       param1 = value1,
       param2 = value2
   )
   ```

   instead of

   ```kotlin
   someFunction(param1 = value1, param2 = value2)
   ```

3. Lambda expressions
   Always use new lines for lambda expressions.

   **Context:** This improves readability and makes it easier to understand the structure of the
   lambda.
   e.g.
   Use

   ```kotlin
   list.filter {
       it.isValid()
   }
   ```

   instead of

   ```kotlin
   list.filter { it.isValid() }
   ```

4. Chained method calls
   Always put chained method calls on separate lines when there are at least 2 method calls chained.

   **Context:** This improves readability, especially when dealing with long chains of method calls.
   e.g.
   Use

   ```kotlin
   someObject
       .methodOne()
       .methodTwo()
       .methodThree()
   ```

   instead of

   ```kotlin
   someObject.methodOne().methodTwo().methodThree()
   ```

5. Function parameters
   - Put parameters in single line for Java method calls if they fit within a line, if not put
     each parameter in a separate line.
   - For every function declaration, always place each parameter in separate line. Do NOT add empty
     lines when there are not parameters.

## Trailing Commas

1. Use trailing commas wherever applicable.

   **Context:** Trailing commas can make version control diffs cleaner and reduce the need for
   additional changes when adding new items to lists or function calls.
   e.g.
   Use

   ```kotlin
   val list = listOf(
       item1,
       item2,
       item3,
   )
   ```

   instead of

   ```kotlin
   val list = listOf(
       item1,
       item2,
       item3
   )
   ```

## Naming Conventions

1. **Classes and Objects:**

   - Use PascalCase for class and object names (e.g., `MainActivity`, `UserRepository`).
   - Use descriptive names that clearly indicate their purpose.

2. **Functions and Variables:**

   - Use camelCase for function and variable names (e.g., `getUserData()`, `userName`).
   - Use descriptive names that explain what the function does or what the variable contains.

3. **Constants:**
   - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`).
4. **Package Names:**
   - Use lowercase with dots as separators (e.g., `com.makeappssimple.abhimanyu.app`).
5. **File Names:**
   - Use PascalCase for file names, matching the primary class name (e.g., `MainActivity.kt`).

## Code Organization

1. **File Structure:**
   1. Package declaration
   2. Import statements (alphabetically ordered)
   3. Class/object declaration
   4. Properties
   5. Constructor
   6. Functions – public first, then internal, followed by private. Order the methods
      alphabetically within each visibility modifier section.
   7. Companion object (if any)
2. **Import Organization:**
   - Group imports: standard library, third-party libraries, project-specific imports.
   - Use explicit imports instead of wildcard imports.
   - Remove unused imports.

## Visibility Modifiers

1. **Default to Private:**
   - Use `private` as the default visibility modifier.
   - Use `internal` for module-level visibility when needed.
   - Use `public` only when the API is intentionally exposed.
2. **Testing:**
   - Use the `@VisibleForTesting` annotation for internal functions that need to be tested.

## Indentation:

1. Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs).

## Line Length:

1. Keep lines under 120 characters when possible.
2. Break long lines at logical points.

## Spacing:

1. Use single spaces around operators and after commas.
2. Do not use spaces before colons in type declarations.

## Named Parameters:

1. Always use named parameters when calling pure Kotlin functions except when the parameter has
   vararg.
2. Always put each named argument on a separate line even for a single named argument.
3. Do NOT use named parameters for Java method calls.

## Trailing Lambda:

1. Avoid using trailing lambdas. Prefer using named paramters instead.

## End of files:

1. Files should always end with an empty line.

## Method Ordering

1. **Order of Methods:**
   - Public methods first, followed by internal methods, and then private methods.
   - Within each visibility modifier, order methods alphabetically.

## Function Design

1. **Single Responsibility:**
   - Each function should have a single, clear purpose.
   - Keep functions small and focused.
2. **Parameters:**
   - Use meaningful parameter names.
   - Consider using data classes for multiple related parameters.
3. **Return Types:**
   - Always specify return types for public functions.
   - Use nullable types (`Type?`) when the function can return null.

## Error Handling

1. **Exceptions:**
   - Use specific exception types rather than generic `Exception`.
   - Always document exceptions that can be thrown by any function.
2. **Null Safety:**
   - Prefer non-nullable types when possible.
   - Always use the safe call operator (`?.`) and Elvis operator (`?:`) appropriately.
   - Never use `!!`.
   - Always use safe type casting (`as?`).
   - Never use forced casting (`as`).

## Documentation

1. **KDoc Comments:**
   - Use KDoc for public APIs and complex functions.
   - Include `@param`, `@return`, and `@throws` tags where appropriate.
2. **Inline Comments:**
   - Use comments to explain "why," not "what."
   - Keep comments up to date with code changes.

## Testing

1. **Test Naming:**
   - Name test classes with the suffix `Test` (e.g., `UserRepositoryTest`).
   - Name test functions in the format `functionUnderTest_condition_expectedResult` (e.g.,
     `login_withInvalidCredentials_returnsError`).
   - Use backticks for descriptive test names (e.g., `fun `login fails with invalid credentials``).
2. **Test File Location:**
   - Place unit tests in the corresponding `test/` directory, mirroring the main source structure.
   - Place instrumented tests in the `androidTest/` directory.
3. **Test Structure:**
   - Use the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for organizing test logic.
   - Use `@Before` and `@After` for setup and teardown logic.
4. **Spacing:**
   - Within each test method, separate arrange, act, and assert sections with empty lines.
   - Do not add unnecessary comments in tests to segregate arrange, act and assert sections.
5. **Visibility and Annotations:**
   - Use `@Test` for test methods.
   - Use `@VisibleForTesting` for internal members that need to be accessed in tests.
   - Prefer `internal` or `private` visibility for test helpers within test files.
   - Use `private` or `internal` for test classes.
6. **Mocking and Dependency Injection:**
   - Use dependency injection to provide test doubles (mocks, fakes, stubs).
   - Prefer using fakes over mocks.
   - Use mock libraries for mocking dependencies only when required, such as at the last level of
     application interaction (e.g., database, files, network, etc.).
7. **Best Practices:**
   - Each test should verify a single behavior or outcome.
   - Avoid shared state between tests; use setup methods to initialize state.
   - Use constants for test data to avoid magic values.
   - Keep tests fast and isolated from external dependencies.
   - Prefer using test-specific coroutine dispatchers for coroutine-based code.
8. **Assertions:**
   - Use expressive assertion libraries (e.g., Truth, AssertJ, JUnit assertions).
   - Prefer `assertThat` over `assertEquals` for readability.
   - Always use `com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertThat` for assertions.

## Dependency Injection

1. DI methods should always have `provides` as the prefix (not `provide`).

# TOML Files

## Naming Conventions

1. **Section Names:**
   - Use `[versions]`, `[libraries]`, `[plugins]`, and `[bundles]` as top-level sections.
2. **Version Keys:**
   - Use lowercase, hyphen-separated keys (e.g., `compile-sdk`, `kotlinx-coroutines-swing`).
   - For app versions, use the format: `app-<module>-version-code` and `app-<module>-version-name`.
   - For plugin versions, use the format: `plugin-<plugin-name>`.
3. **Library Keys:**
   - Use the format `<group>-<artifact>` (e.g., `androidx-activity-compose`,
     `kotlinx-coroutines-core`).
   - For bundles, use a single word representing the group (e.g., `camera`, `compose`).
   - For test libraries, prefix with `test-` (e.g., `test-ext-junit`).
4. **Reference Keys:**
   - Use `module` for specifying the full Maven coordinate.
   - Use `version.ref` for referencing version keys (e.g., `version.ref = "kotlinx-coroutines"`).

## Ordering Conventions

1. **Section Order:**
   - `[versions]` (app, SDK, library, and plugin versions)
   - `[libraries]` (dependencies)
   - `[plugins]` (plugin definitions)
   - `[bundles]` (dependency bundles)
2. **Within Sections:**

   - Alphabetize keys within each section for readability and consistency.
   - Group related items (e.g., all `androidx-` libraries together, all `koin-` libraries
     together).
   - For bundles, list dependencies in logical or usage order (e.g., camera-related libraries
     together).

   **Example:**

   ```
   [versions]
   kotlinx-coroutines = "1.10.2"
   kotlin = "2.1.21"

   [libraries]
   kotlinx-coroutines-core = { module = "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core", version.ref = "kotlinx-coroutines" }
   kotlin = { module = "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin", version.ref = "kotlin" }

   [plugins]
   plugin-kotlin-android = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android", version.ref = "plugin-kotlin" }

   [bundles]
   compose = [
       "androidx-activity-compose",
       "androidx-compose-foundation",
       "androidx-compose-runtime",
       "androidx-compose-material3",
   ]
   ```
